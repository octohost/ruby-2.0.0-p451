ruby-2.0.0-p451
===============

Base Ruby 2.0.0-p451 container for octohost.

To use an already built container:

`docker pull octohost/ruby-2.0.0-p451`

Or you can build it from this source:

`docker build -t your-organization/ruby-2.0.0-p451`

NOTE: You can always get the most current ruby 2.0 container this way:

`docker pull octohost/ruby-2.0`
